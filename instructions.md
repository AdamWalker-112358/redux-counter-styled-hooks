==================================
##  Pick a Color!! 🎨 👩🏻‍🎨 🎨 👩🏻‍🎨 🎨 👩🏻‍🎨
==================================


1. Your task is to create _2_ new and separate view components:
   `ColorPicker.view.jsx` and `ColorDisplay.view.jsx`

2. ColorPicker will contain _3_ buttons to choose 3 colors
   – `red`, `green` and `blue`

3. ColorDisplay will contain a view that displays the chosen color.
   It can be a simple label stating the color name.
   Focus on functionality. Styling and looks are secondary.

4. Create another button in `Counter.view` that will increment the count value by 5 without changing the functionality of the existing buttons.

5. Create and configure a middleware function to save state changes to localstorage
6. On app start - check and preload saved state from localstorage if it exists

To complete this challenge you will need to:

- create view components and connect them to redux
- create actions & reducers
- modify the app state
- create middleware
- preload the store initial state

---
Much success!
